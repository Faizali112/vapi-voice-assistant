## 🚀 Getting Started (Run Locally in 10 Minutes)

### 1. 📦 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/voice-ai-agent.git
cd voice-ai-agent
```

---

### 2. 📥 Install Dependencies

#### 👉 For Python (Flask backend)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 👉 For Node.js (Webhook backend)

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3. 🔐 Add API Keys & Credentials

Create a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

Then place these in the root folder:
- `credentials.json` → Download from Google Cloud Console
- `token.json` → Will be auto-generated on first OAuth login

> ✅ Make sure `.env`, `credentials.json`, and `token.json` are all listed in `.gitignore`.

---

### 4. 🌐 Start the Flask Server

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, it runs on: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

---

### 5. 🛜 Expose Your Server with Ngrok

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the `https://` forwarding link (e.g., `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io`).

---

### 6. 🧠 Set Up Your VAPI Workflow

1. Go to [VAPI.ai dashboard](https://app.vapi.ai)
2. Create a new **Voice Agent**
3. In the Workflow:
   - Add a **"Start" block**
   - Then add a **Webhook block**
   - Paste your Ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io/webhook`)
4. (Optional) Add an OpenAI block if needed
5. Click **Publish**

---

### 7. 🗣️ Start Talking to Your Assistant

1. Click "Start Call" on VAPI
2. Say "Hello" and start the conversation
3. Ask it to **schedule a Google Meet**, and it will!
